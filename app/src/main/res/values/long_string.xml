    <string name="FrGeorgeJWillMannSJ">Blessed are You, Almighty Father, source of all goodness and wisdom. Look down upon us Your children, who are trying to serve You with all our heart. Deign to raise Fr. George J. Willmann to the honors of the altar.\n\nHe was the prayerful, strong, dauntless model that we all need in this new era, he was a pastor in the care and formation of the youth; the relief of victims of war and violence; the alleviation of the suffering of the poor and the preservation and promotion of the sanctity of life, marriage, and the family.\n\nMake him the lamp on the lamp stand giving light to all in the house. Make him the city set on the mountain which cannot be hidden, so that all of us may learn from his courage, his integrity, his indomitable spirit in propagating and living the Gospel.\n\nThrough his intercession, bestow on us the favor we ask You in faith (pause here and silently entrust to the Lord your petitions). Through Christ our Lord. Amen.</string>
